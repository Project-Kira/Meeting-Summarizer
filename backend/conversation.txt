Thank you all for attending. Let's begin with the first presentation. Our company produces compact water filtration units designed for remote construction and temporary field operations. They require no external power source and reduce reliance on transported water. What is your differentiator compared to standard filtration systems? Portability and rapid deployment. Setup time is under ten minutes. Market size? We estimate demand from construction, disaster response, and mining sites at approximately 50,000 units annually in xxxxxxxxx. And your current manufacturing capability? We produce 200 units monthly and can increase to 1,000 with new capital to automate assembly. Understood. Let's hear from the second team. We developed forecasting software for building material procurement. It integrates supplier inventories, historical project timelines, and transportation data to minimize waste. How is pricing structured? Subscription tiers: project-based licenses and enterprise agreements for large developers. Early adoption results? Three pilot clients reduced over-ordering by 17% on average. Next steps? Scale pilot installations and expand supplier integration partnerships. We will review proposals and reconvene with funding decisions.
